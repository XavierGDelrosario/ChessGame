## What will the application do?
    After the console application part of developement, the user will be able play chess by clicking on one of their 
    pieces and click on another square to move that piece aslong as it follows the rules. After the game ends it will be
    saved so that the user can load and review board positions that occured.

capture it as if it only moved 1 square, only on the following turn.
- **Castling:** The king moves two squares towards a rook and the rook moves to the king's other side such that it is 
closer to the center as long as the following conditions are met:
  - Both the king and rook have not moved yet.
  - The king is not in check
  - There are no pieces in between the rook and king.
  - Opposing pieces can't capture on the squares the king passes.

- **Checkmate:** When a player can't make a legal move to get out of check, they lose.
- **Stalemate:** When a player can't make a legal move but their king is not in check it is a draw.

## Who will use it?
    The chess application can be used by any two people that are interested in playing. It has to be two players because
    the user will not be able to play against AI.
## Why this project interests me.
    My interest in programming started from my interest in video games. When I practice coding, I like to make games. 
    One reason is that I can play and test at the same time. It makes it less frustrating when bugs occur. I chose 
    chess because I enjoy playing it and it has the right amount of complexity for my knowledge in programming.
